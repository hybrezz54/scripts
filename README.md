# scripts

This repo is designed to contain scripts I have written that will be useful on any computer. I am updating it with Python, Powershell, and batch scripts which can then be used by anyone!

### Script Descriptions
Here is a list of the scripts and their descriptions:
* **new_windows_setup.ps1:** This Powershell script allows one to setup a new Windows install with specified software and also clones this repository to your Documents folder. Just store this script on your usb drive and you can run it on any computer!
* **update-all.cmd:** A batch file that will upgrade all packages installed via the Chocolatey and Python package managers. This file is to be used in conjunction with the setup script above to update installed software as needed from anywhere (Above script adds to user's PATH).
* **call_reminder.py:** This is a Python script that will process scheduling reports for a doctor's office. You probably won't need this script but can use it for inspiration as it uses the pandas module.
* **dir_cleanup.py:** A python script to clean up unneeded files, for example, in a Downloads folder.
* **event_scraper.py:** *Work in progress*
* **slumber.py:** *Work in progress*
* **trash_schedule.py:** *Work in progress*
